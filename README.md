# best_in_show

For our project, we set out with a goal to be able to predict movies that have the greatest chance of winning Best Picture (also previously known as Outstanding Motion Picture, Outstanding Picture, Outstanding Production, and Best Motion Picture) at the Academy Awards. We were able to find a dataset which held all of the winners and nominees for all categories included at the Academy Awards. This set our first challenge of creating a data frame from this data and cleaning it. It was a very large data set, however got down to a much more manageable number once we cleaned and filtered for only the category of Best Picture (also all its previous aliases). Once we had this portion completed we found an API key which we then used our data frame to compare the movies we were able to find.

The data frame we created using our csv and our API required a lot of cleaning. It was important that we started by recognizing we needed to change many of our columns to int64. After this we also saw issues with some of our columns having multiple data pieces within one column. This required us to utilize the split function. However, after this it was recognized that we actually needed to create many columns which contained all the genre names and then have a 1 or 0 be the data to represent if the movie in question fell in that category or not.
