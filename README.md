# best_in_show

For our project, we set out with a goal to be able to predict movies that have the greatest chance of winning Best Picture (also previously known as Outstanding Motion Picture, Outstanding Picture, Outstanding Production, and Best Motion Picture) at the Academy Awards. We were able to find a dataset which held all of the winners and nominees for all categories included at the Academy Awards. This set our first challenge of creating a data frame from this data and cleaning it. It was a very large data set, however got down to a much more manageable number once we cleaned and filtered for only the category of Best Picture (also all its previous aliases).

Once we had this portion completed we found an API key which we then used our data frame to compare the films we were able to find.  We filtered through and found which films within our csv data were able to be found in our API key by comparing on like variables.

The data frame we created using our csv and our API required a lot of cleaning. It was important that we started by recognizing we needed to change many of our columns to int64. After this we also saw issues with some of our columns having multiple data pieces within one column, the most noted example being our genre column.<img width="972" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 7 14 44 PM" src="https://github.com/joannasantana/best_in_show/assets/129118228/d0c9ed96-4f2c-4ca8-a268-db03c02cd1d6">

This required us to utilize the split function and try to split on the comma of the genres. However, after this it was recognized that we actually needed to create many columns which contained all the genre names and one-hot-encoding and then having a "1" or "0" be the data to represent if the movie in question fell in that category or not respectively.

After cleaning all this information it was finally time for us to utilize our data and attempt to teach this model to predict the future "Best Picture" at the Academy Awards.  In order to do this we had to do the linear regression.  Unfortunately, the best we could seem to get was about 0.53 which was when we also used data collected on the Golden Globes to also help predict winners.  One of the difficulties we found at this point in the project was an 'nan' value being given in one of our columns, which we believed could be skewing the data.

In order to get through this issue, we had to go back in and update our columns in order to ensure that did not show up and change our data.  As you can see in our updated columns there is no 'nan' present.  After this, we noticed some more issues with our predictive model in the fact that we had not scaled our data.  After looking through this we determined that scaling our data and recognizing which columns were possibly skewing our data.  One of the issues was that our columns which may have been written numerically did not actually represent numeric data (for example the years though written as numbers were not numerical data).  We saw a large improvement in the effectiveness of our model once we scaled our data!

After recreating and scaling our model, we were officially ready to start using it to try and predict the 2024 Oscar Winners!  We ran the model with films that are predicted to be nominated for best picture to see how they add up to one another using our model. Unfortunately, our model said none of them would win.  We considered that this may be since we do not have the Golden Globes winners for 2024 yet this year, so we manipulated the data to say "Oppenheimer" won the Golden Globe.  In that case our model will then predict that "Oppenheimer" will win 'Best Picture' at the Oscars in 2024. <img width="1038" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8 35 22 AM" src="https://github.com/joannasantana/best_in_show/assets/129118228/670a71fc-1b23-4ef6-9414-d30ef53d933b">
However, we are aware that our model is not foolproof.  Our idea was to test films viewed as "snubbed" in their year to see if our model would correctly determine that they did not win.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  "Singin' in the Rain" was famously snubbed from a 'Best Picture' nomination, however based on our model "Singin' in the Rain" would have won!  <img width="478" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 8 39 12 AM" src="https://github.com/joannasantana/best_in_show/assets/129118228/bac05c9b-71b2-4edc-a064-079413aab21e">
So obviously, it still has many improvements to be made in order for it to give a more accurate prediction.  Based on the information we have used, we were rather happy with how our model performed!
